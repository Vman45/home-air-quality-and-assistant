# Home Air Quality plus Voice Assistant

This is project is a result of Covid-19 lockdown :)
I've start with a simple monitoring tool to display in-door air quality using PMS5003ST or PMS7003 sensors and Raspberry Pi Zero with Waveshare 3.5inch display. Then things started to evolve :)
Finally, the project includes:
- a script/service for brightness control of Waveshare 3.5" display, that does not support this functionality OOB (see wiki how hacked my way to add this functionality)
- a voice assistant service that works offline to:
  - display weather and Moon details (thanks to [wttr.in](https://github.com/chubin/wttr.in) - awesome project btw)
  - tell some old jokes (using 'fortune' linux command)
  - state uptime
  - initiate reboot

*BTW, these LEGO bricks are almost 30 years old (!)*


## Hardware Requirements

- [Raspberry Pi Zero](https://botland.com.pl/moduly-i-zestawy-raspberry-pi-zero/9749-raspberry-pi-zero-wh-512mb-ram-wifi-bt-41-ze-zlaczami.html) or similar
- PMS7003 or PMS5003ST sensors
- Waveshare 3.5" inch display for Raspberry Pi
- mini usb soundcard - try to find not the cheapest ones, but rather of good quality to have good microphone input (no noise etc)
- a mini microphone
- a mini speaker plus AMP module to power it up from stereo output
- 16GB SD card (as fast as possible)

## Installation

- install [Raspbian Buster](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/) on SD card using [this](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md) instruction
- enable and configure WiFi before you start the system - more [here](https://howchoo.com/g/ndy1zte2yjn/how-to-set-up-wifi-on-your-raspberry-pi-without-ethernet)
- find the IP of RPi by scanning your local network or take a look at your router to find a new device connected to your network
- SSH to your raspberry: ```ssh pi@10.20.30.40```
- install git: ```sudo apt install git```
- issue the command to fetch this project: ```git clone https://github.com/pskowronek/home-air-quality-and-assistant.git```
- go to the project directory: ```cd home-air-quality-and-assistant``` and run the automatic installer: ```./install.sh``` - this should hopefully install everything you need
  - if it fails then please try to analyze any error statements and follow instructions if provided
  - use Raspbian Buster, if you have Stretch the consider upgrading (a good instructions are [here](http://baddotrobot.com/blog/2019/08/29/upgrade-raspian-stretch-to-buster/))
  - before you report a bug, try to google it first :)
- The installer above should ask you whether you want to register 3 services: visualizer, brightness, assistant (brightness is optional if don't have LCD display that supports this).
This will let those service to automatically run when Raspberry boots up (more details [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/linux/usage/systemd.md))
  - verify if service works by invoking the following commands:
    - ``sudo systemctl start visualizer.service```
    - ``sudo systemctl start brightness.service```
    - ``sudo systemctl start assistant.service```
  - reboot device to verify if it works
  - logs can be observed in /var/log/syslog: ```sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog```
